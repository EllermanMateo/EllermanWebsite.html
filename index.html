  My name is Ellerman Mateo. I am a talented Cross Country and Track athlete from the Mighty state of Florida. I find that running relieves me of stress and enables a way for me to become closer to Mother Nature. I strive towards engagement in the community and becoming a stronger, postive influence to mankind. I currently attend Phillips Academy Andover and my favorite class is computer science- probably because it will teach me how to hack. Don't tell Dr. Z! No really, it is very fascinating how to use simple lines of code to create sophisticated workpieces and the world is becoming more technologically advanced everyday, so we will need more programmers.

  The thought of software predicting the likelihood of future criminals seems like technology in the near decades, however; it exists today but with some discrepancies. From a New York Times article, a question directed towards Chief Justice Roberts Jr. highlighted a concern to jurisdiction. Moreover, the response from the chief justice brought up Compas, a software that assessed potential criminals, that created controversy in the Wisconsin Supreme Court vs. Loomis. Despite generating an assessment of Loomis, the court admitted some uncertainty in the reliability of the secret algorithm. Notably, even Wisconsin's attorney general and Justice Bradley warned of allowing Compas to dictate sentences, solely. Still, the NY Times article only mentions one case and other similar cases should be included to build up validity in its claims. The idea that Compas and related softwares are in more courtspears exciting, but the way they have become too dependent on is concerning. To me, Northpointe is somewhat offsetting crime sentences and should consider improvements for its flaws between evaluating individuals, as both ProPublica and NY Times agree that blacks are more likely incorrectly assessed as opposed to whites. A solution to Compas is to improve their system against unfair discrimination and add more flexibility into their software by increasing its ability to take into consideration multiple scenarios like economic status as well as educational and social backgrounds. Nevertheless, Compas is a great revolution to the criminal justice system as crime is increasing into the U.S., according to a NY Times and USA Today report., and the ability to filter people can greatly ease the tension in jails/prisons as there is overcrowding- mostly from awaiting trial (NY Post). But Compas allows courts to determine if it is necessary to incarcerate individuals and is an advancement in technology that can one day, be more reliable and credible. If it were up to me, I would use Compas as somewhere were to start on a sentence yet rely on the entire background of the individual to determine the appropriate level of sentence. An awesome software, but Compas still has a long way to go before it can be fully trusted as many websites lash out at its incompetence (like MIT Technology, NY Times and ProPublica).

According to a TEDGlobal speaking by Tufekci "We're building a dystopia just to make people click on ads," despite "well-intentioned" choices by algorithm designers, the methods of algorithms can essentially control people, indirectly. One example is the scene where one person might start watch on YouTube video but then spend an hour watching dozens more. Moreover, experiments conducted on Google and Facebook reveal that their algorithms targets individuals who are susceptible to certain ads quite easily. A YouTube video on "How ads work on YouTube," reinforces the idea that ads are coded to certain people who meet the standards for particular behavior or viewing the material. For instance -when watching the YouTube video- an ad appeared on cue by the narrator which almost seemed eerie. According to the Washington Post, ads on Facebook proved crucial to the 2016 presidential election, particularly (now president) Donald Trump. During the campaign, the Trump campaign spent millions targeting people on Facebook, but by identifying those with similar characteristics relating to the target of the ads and those important to the polls. As technology advance, more people are spending time on online devices and exposed to advertisements that match their behavior and beliefs, etc. A concerning idea about the aspect of programming behind ads is that people receive them based on their search history and it can be dangerous messages that the users are unaware of. Of these sources, all agree that often an ad will appear that seems completely random however is somehow connected. I do not like to think that when I can legally vote, that I will be targeted when there are government elections and that there will be extremist messages that are conveyed to me. Despite ads being somewhat invasive, the process of managing ads seems practically impossible as stated by the TEDGlobal spokesperson, nevertheless; one solution might be to purchase an ad-free subscription as I find it disturbing upon the effect of ads. However, those unwilling to purchase ad-free access are exposed to an ad that an algorithm sends them and that these programs restrictions are limitless. Overall, there is no plausible method to avoid ads that reflect one's personality, which quite frankly, is frightening. Who knows how many ads anyone is exposed to and which ones are negative? To me, no one is invincible to advertisements and when pondering about it is unimaginable and conflicting.

  Throughout the years, the significance of net neutrality has been consistently debated, and one question comes to mind, why do America still have it? In a podcast "The Neutral Zone" by IRL, major points from both frontiers were included. Major companies like AT&T and Comcast agree that the regulations regarding net neutrality should be discarded since it "is fundamental to competition." According to a Mozilla study, 76% of Americans support the freedom from net neutrality. On the other hand, supporters like Barbara van S. and Dominic Girard highlight the consequences of blocking and discrimination as well as network traffic which can be supported through a European experiment with an "open Internet." However, based on the podcast findings, most Americans favor an anti-net neutrality which a Forbes article focuses on three main key points. Like net neutrality, the article agrees that a consequence without net neutrality would be more competition, which appears like an excellent benefit to achieve products that people desire. Likewise, more liberals call towards privacy against government regulation in the Internet as well as more freedom. Nowadays, there are countless movements towards liberty, some of which are gun control policies, border-immigration crises, and sexual abuses through government officials, etc. The advantages of life without net neutrality appear to be working towards the common good, however; like Belmont noted, the "people have well-intentions but are misdirected." Based on the two sources, I personally feel that net neutrality is here to stay. One important aspect of net neutrality is that the National Security Agency (NSA) can regulate potential terrorists' communication as well as illegal activities. I recognize that Americans enjoy privacy, however; it is a social contract where the government protects the country for the sacrifice of certain liberties, for the common good. A free open market on the Internet seems ideal, but it is concerning that companies can dictate their service to consumers and lower standards. Even when people move to different companies, there is not the guaranties of better service and would increase complications. More importantly, having equal Internet speed connection is the most alluring in liberals who hope to have fair opportunities for all.

As technology advances every day, there is the concern of automation machines taking over the workplace, consequently ending in increasing rates of unemployment according to a YouTube video "Humans not need apply"- CGP Grey. One reason is that programmers are enabling algorithms in machines that permit them to think and learn by independently through experience. On the other hand, an article by The Economist "Automation and Anxiety" eases the worries of workers by saying that even though machines might take up some jobs, the bigger effect would be that more jobs would be created. Another article by McKinsey&&Company "The digital future of work: What will automation change?" includes interviews by professors from New York University as well as other high-ranking CEOs of other companies. The main points issued were that it is inevitable that jobs will be replaced by robots, by that the future should be looked with optimism which is essential for growing the economy as well as for human progress. After all these articles, one great dilemma is that there is the potential for a growing inequality gap between the low-skilled and the highly-skilled individuals. Moreover, as lower-skilled jobs are being substituted, people who are unable to pursue a higher education for uncontested jobs are in danger of unemployment. In addition, there are approximately 11 million immigrants illegally in U.S.A. (Washington Post) who generally incapable to attend college or finish high school as many are illiterate or are fearful of being exposed by federal agencies and sent to their country of origin. However, I personally feel that despite growing gaps, the benefits far outweigh the repercussions and is necessary for the country to be able to meet the demands of the growing population as there is the danger of overpopulation in the world. Machines can do things that no human could physically and mentally accomplish with greater accuracy and precision. There is not fear for artificial intelligence takeover of the world as depicted in movies like Terminator or Ready Player One. Nevertheless, there is the uncertainty that machines can be used in wrongful intentions that could harm lives such as someone hacking a self-driving car and causing it to malfunction. Also, a concern is that humans can become too reliant on machines that perform very manageable tasks that can make people passive and in the event of a global power failure, could cripple the entire human race. Still, I am learning Computer Science in the hopes of understanding the complexity of artificial intelligence and plan on contributing to the rise of automation.
